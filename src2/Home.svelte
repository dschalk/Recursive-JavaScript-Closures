<p> This is where I store code snippets, discoveries, and ideas that I don't want to forget, or that might be useful to others. Eventually I might adopt the usual reverse chronology blog format, but for now I am piecing together what I want to salvage from piles of disorganized computer code and a head full of ideas and memories I want to preserve. </p>
