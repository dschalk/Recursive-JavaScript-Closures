COMPLETE ERADICATION OF BED BUGS
 </div>
{/if}
<p>It is widely believed that the only reliable way to eraacate a bed bug infestation is to pay thousands of dollars for a thorough heat treatment; one that sends deadly heat through drywall and insullation all the way to the exterior walls. I had a massive bed bug infestation in my rented condominium. My box springs were on the floor, making it easy for bed bugs to climb onto my mattress and feast on me -- and increase in numbers exponentially.</p>
<span> As I researched the life cycle of bed bugs, it became clear that bed bugs are far easier to eradicate than termites or cock roaches: </span>

<h3>Pertinent Facts About Bed Bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blood is the only substance that nourishes them. </li>
<li>After emerging from eggs, bed bug nymphs molt five times.</li>
<li>Stage one nymphs can't survive beyond two months at room temperature without blood.</li>
<li>Mature bed bugs don't survive more than six months at room temperature.</li>
<li>Nymphs must have blood before each of their five moltings.</li>
<li>Bed bugs will go to the source of exhaled carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>After sufficient (not much) contact with silica gel, bed bugs dry up and die within three days.</li>
<li>Silica gel is not systemically toxic, but it is a respiratory tract irritant. </li>
<li>Cimex® silica gel is very expensive but a five-pound bag from Ebay is pretty cheap.</li>
</ul>
<p> I put the box spring on a metal frame with each leg in a bed bug trap. I encased the mattress but not the box spring because I could see through the mesh on the bottom that no bugs had entered.</p> 
<p>A coffee grinder was used to Fluff the silica gel (obtained from Ebay) which was then applied (with a big yellow puffer from Amazon.com) under and around my bed and between the box spring and matterss. </p> 
<p> I knew bed bugs would not lay dormant in furnature, walls, and rugs when they sensed a source of carbon dioxide. I was confident that failing to find a route to my bed around the silica gel they would give up and walk through silica gel in an effort to obtain blood. Their life expectancy was then a couple of days, at most.</p>
<p> I puffed silica gel into light sockets and anywhere a wall panel could be removed. Soon, the only bed bugs I could find were located in upholstered furniture. I could have killed them, but I decided to throw the invested furnitue away. </p>


<p> Professional exterminators get unsatisfactory results with silica gel because they won't leave a site that has visible white powder on the floor. They tried applying silica gel in water, which seems absurd since silica gel kills bed bugs by drying them out.</p>
<p> The little packets of drying agent found in jars and bags of commercial consumer goods usually contain silica gel. USDA regulations allow up to two percent silica gel in food. You should wear a dust mask while dispensing silica gel with a puffer, or else hold your breath and rush into an adjacent room when you need air.</p>
<p> Professional eradicators don't leave visible residues on floors. That is why they get poor results with silica gel; results comparable to the ones they get with toxic pesticides. Professional exterminators have been known to apply silica gel dissolved in water, which seems absurd in light of the fact that silica gel kills bed bugs by drying them up.</p>
